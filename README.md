creator: BLGBUDZ and Amazon Q
inspiration from Zi9's CarX Blender Tools

info: 
this was made for people like me that hate having to name/rename meshes to proper namings.. i plan on making an update adding a couple more features but itll be this way for some time..

Features:
- gives proper naming to layers / objects
- when setting the names of mesh for pit/times/start, each button "SHOULD" auto place a null.dds image texture on them so you dont have to worry about it


THIS IS THE FIRST PLUGIN IV MADE FOR BLENDER!!! Any problems/issues can be reported to me on discord - https://discord.gg/wbXYrhWC8W
